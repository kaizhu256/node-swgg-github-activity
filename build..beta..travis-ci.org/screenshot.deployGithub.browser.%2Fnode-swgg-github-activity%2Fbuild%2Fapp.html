Serving up the 'social' in Social Coding, the Activity APIs provide access to notifications, subscriptions, and timelines.

# [Event Types &amp; Payloads]()

Each event has a similar JSON schema, but a unique ```payload``` object that is determined by its event type.

Event names are used by [repository webhooks]() to specify which events the webhook should receive. The included payloads below are from webhook deliveries but match events returned by the [Events API]() (except where noted). The Events API uses the CamelCased name (e.g. ```CommitCommentEvent```) in the ```type``` field of an event object and does not include the ```repository``` or ```sender``` fields in the event payload object.

**Note:** Some of these events may not be rendered in timelines, they're only created for various internal and webhook purposes.
- [CommitCommentEvent]()
- [CreateEvent]()
- [DeleteEvent]()
- [DeploymentEvent]()
- [DeploymentStatusEvent]()

# [Events]()

This is a read-only API to the GitHub events. These events power the various activity streams on the site.
- [List public events]()
- [List repository events]()
- [List issue events for a repository]()
- [List public events for a network of repositories]()
- [List public events for an organization]()
- [List events that a user has received]()
- [List public events that a user has received]()
- [List events performed by a user]()
- [List public events performed by a user]()
- [List events for an organization]()

Events are optimized for polling with the "ETag" header.  If no new events have been triggered, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, and your current rate limit will be untouched.  There is also an "X-Poll-Interval" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll.  In times of high server load, the time may increase.  Please obey the header.
```
curl -I 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Poll-Interval: 60
ETag: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"
# The quotes around the ETag value are important
curl -I  \
   -H 'If-None-Match: "a18c3bded88eb5dbb5c849a489412bf3"'
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
X-Poll-Interval: 60
```


Events support [pagination](), however the ```per_page``` option is unsupported. The fixed page size is 30 items. Fetching up to ten pages is supported, for a total of 300 events.

Only events created within the past 90 days will be included in timelines. Events older than 90 days will not be included (even if the total number of events in the timeline is less than 300).

All Events have the same response format:
```
Status: 200 OK
Link: &lt;;; rel="next",
      &lt;;; rel="last"
```

```

# [Notifications]()

Users receive notifications for conversations in repositories they watch including:
- Issues and their comments
- Pull Requests and their comments
- Comments on any commits

Notifications are also sent for conversations in unwatched repositories when the user is involved including:
- **@mentions**
- Issue assignments
- Commits the user authors or commits
- Any discussion in which the user actively participates

All Notification API calls require the ```notifications``` or ```repo``` API scopes.  Doing this will give read-only access to some Issue/Commit content. You will still need the "repo" scope to access Issues and Commits from their respective endpoints.

Notifications come back as "threads".  A Thread contains information about the current discussion of an Issue/PullRequest/Commit.

Notifications are optimized for polling with the "Last-Modified" header.  If there are no new notifications, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, leaving your current rate limit untouched.  There is an "X-Poll-Interval" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll.  In times of high server load, the time may increase.  Please obey the header.
```
# Add authentication to your requests
curl -I 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Last-Modified: Thu, 25 Oct 2012 15:16:27 GMT
X-Poll-Interval: 60
# Pass the Last-Modified header exactly
curl -I 
   -H "If-Modified-Since: Thu, 25 Oct 2012 15:16:27 GMT"

# [Starring]()

Repository Starring is a feature that lets users bookmark repositories.  Stars are shown next to repositories to show an approximate level of interest.  Stars have no effect on notifications or the activity feed.  For that, see [Repository Watching]().

####  Starring vs. Watching

In August 2012, we [changed the way watching works]() on GitHub.  Many API client applications may be using the original "watcher" endpoints for accessing this data. You can now start using the "star" endpoints instead (described below). Check out the [Watcher API Change post]() for more details.

# [Watching]()

Watching a Repository registers the user to receive notifications on new discussions, as well as events in the user's activity feed.  See [Repository Starring]() for simple repository bookmarks.

####  Watching vs. Starring

In August 2012, we [changed the way watching works]() on GitHub.  At the time of that change, many API clients were already using the existing "watcher" endpoints to access starring data. To avoid breaking those applications, the legacy "watcher" endpoints continue to provide starring data.

To provide access to watching data, the v3 Watcher API uses the "subscription" endpoints described below. Check out the [Watcher API Change post]() for more details.

<h1 id="-event-types-amp-payloads-https-developer-github-com-v3-activity-events-types-"><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/">Event Types &amp; Payloads</a></h1>
<p>Each event has a similar JSON schema, but a unique <code>payload</code> object that is determined by its event type.</p>
<p>Event names are used by <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/">repository webhooks</a> to specify which events the webhook should receive. The included payloads below are from webhook deliveries but match events returned by the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/">Events API</a> (except where noted). The Events API uses the CamelCased name (e.g. <code>CommitCommentEvent</code>) in the <code>type</code> field of an event object and does not include the <code>repository</code> or <code>sender</code> fields in the event payload object.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some of these events may not be rendered in timelines, they're only created for various internal and webhook purposes.</p>

<p>Events are optimized for polling with the "ETag" header.  If no new events have been triggered, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, and your current rate limit will be untouched.  There is also an "X-Poll-Interval" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll.  In times of high server load, the time may increase.  Please obey the header.</p>
<pre><code>curl -I https://api.github.com/users/tater/events

</code></pre><p>Events support <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination">pagination</a>, however the <code>per_page</code> option is unsupported. The fixed page size is 30 items. Fetching up to ten pages is supported, for a total of 300 events.</p>
<p>Only events created within the past 90 days will be included in timelines. Events older than 90 days will not be included (even if the total number of events in the timeline is less than 300).</p>
<p>All Events have the same response format:</p>

<p>Users receive notifications for conversations in repositories they watch including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issues and their comments</li>
<li>Pull Requests and their comments</li>
<li>Comments on any commits</li>
</ul>
<p>Notifications are also sent for conversations in unwatched repositories when the user is involved including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>@mentions</strong></li>
<li>Issue assignments</li>
<li>Commits the user authors or commits</li>
<li>Any discussion in which the user actively participates</li>
</ul>
<p>All Notification API calls require the <code>notifications</code> or <code>repo</code> API scopes.  Doing this will give read-only access to some Issue/Commit content. You will still need the "repo" scope to access Issues and Commits from their respective endpoints.</p>
<p>Notifications come back as "threads".  A Thread contains information about the current discussion of an Issue/PullRequest/Commit.</p>
<p>Notifications are optimized for polling with the "Last-Modified" header.  If there are no new notifications, you will see a "304 Not Modified" response, leaving your current rate limit untouched.  There is an "X-Poll-Interval" header that specifies how often (in seconds) you are allowed to poll.  In times of high server load, the time may increase.  Please obey the header.</p>

This is done by adding one or more of the following types to the <code>Accept</code> header when you make a request. Media types are specific to resources, allowing them to change independently and support formats that other resources don't.</p>
